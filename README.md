# Slopes Visualization

This is a small project that helps processing and visualizing displacement data captured from image analysis on slope prototypes. The app reads the data generated by the image analysis software and displays the displacement data to help determine the failure surface of the slope.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
